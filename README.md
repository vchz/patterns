Repository associated with a 5 hours hands-on python course taught at the Biophysics Summer School on "Pattern formation and developmental processes" in Rethymno, Greece, 7-14 July, 2025.\

**Tutorial 1**: simulation and mathematical analysis of the Activation Depletion Substrate Model.\
**Tutorial 2**: contains an implementation of Stochastic Force Inference with the PASTIS criterion, introduced in Frishman A, Ronceray P (2020) Learning Force Fields from Stochastic Trajectories. *Physical Review X* and Gerardos A, Ronceray P (2025) Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2501.10339*.\
**Tutorial 3**: extension of the same approach to SPDEs, and in particular to Turing Patterns. It draws on Maddu S, et al. (2022) Stability selection enables robust learning of differential equations from limited noisy data. *Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences* and uses data in tutorial_3_data/ taken fromn Goehring NW, et al. (2011) Polarization of PAR proteins by advective triggering of a pattern-forming system. *Science*.
